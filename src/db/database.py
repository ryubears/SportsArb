SQLite storage for SportsArb.

One database file holds every table, which makes it easy to open in any
SQLite browser. The tables follow the pipeline in order.

    contracts      what each venue lists, written by fetch.py
    bets           each contract restated in venue neutral terms, by classify.py
    pairs          the contracts on both venues for one bet, by match.py
    gaps           stretches when a venue's feed was down, by market/record.py
    opportunities  every episode the live scanner saw, by market/scan.py
    trades         every trade the executors made, paper or live, by trading/
    settlements    how each trade's legs paid out, by money/settle.py
    orders         every real order the live executor sent, by trading/live.py
    ledger         every paper cash movement per venue, by money/paper.py
    alerts         everything the live process emailed a human, by trading/notify.py

Trades and settlements carry a mode, 'paper' or 'live', and every read of
open trades is for one mode, so paper and live trades never mix.

The tables themselves are in schema.sql, and the steps that bring older
databases up to them in migrations.py. This file holds the reads and writes.
