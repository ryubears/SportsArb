"""
Shared logic for the venue book streams.

A book stream keeps one websocket connection carrying every wanted
contract, keeps a live order book per contract, and hands each change to
a callback. This base class holds what the venues have in common: the
wanted set, the queue of changes made while the connection runs, and the
connect, subscribe, read, and reconnect loop. A venue subclass supplies
how to connect, what to send to subscribe, how to turn a queued change
into a frame, and how to apply one message.

A venue can also stop a market trading while its book stays up: pause it,
close it, or decide it. A stream that hears so from its venue says it
through on_state, see set_state(), so that book is not traded until the
venue says the market trades again.
