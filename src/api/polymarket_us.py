"""
Polymarket US API client.

Three jobs. The query half reads the public events listing on the gateway
host, filtered by sport tag, turns every open market into a Contract, one
per market, for the market's long side, and reads the account's balance.
The streaming half opens the signed markets websocket and keeps a live
book per market slug, replacing the whole book on every message because
the feed sends full snapshots, and says when a market is not open for
trading, from the state each message gives. The trading half sends
signed orders for the live executor. This is the only file that knows
Polymarket US field names and message formats.

Requests to the API host must be signed with the account's key. The key
id and secret live in the data folder, see KEY_ID_FILE and SECRET_KEY_FILE.
