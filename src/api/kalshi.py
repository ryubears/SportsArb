Kalshi API client.

Three jobs. The query half walks series to events to markets on the
public API, sports' and elections', turns every open market into a
Contract, and reads the account's balance. The streaming half opens one websocket with a signed
API key, subscribes to order book updates, and keeps a live book for each
ticker restated from the Yes side so it matches Polymarket US's shape.
Tickers can be added and removed while the connection runs. The trading
half sends signed orders for the live executor. This is the only file
that knows Kalshi's field names and message formats.
