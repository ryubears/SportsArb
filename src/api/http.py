"""
HTTP requests shared by the venue clients.

get_json() reads the public catalogs, retrying on network errors.
send_json() carries the signed trading calls. It keeps connections open
between calls, since a new TLS connection costs several round trips that
an order racing a stale quote cannot spare, and it never retries, since
sending an order twice would trade twice.
