"""
Split the Kalshi cash across the exchange shards live trading uses, by the
percents config.LIVE_SHARDS gives them.

Kalshi keeps the cash on each exchange shard apart, and an order spends
only its market's shard's: football and hockey trade on shard 0, baseball
and basketball on 3. Most of the cash goes to football's, 90 to 10, as
the football futures are where the long-lasting edges are. This reads
the cash on each shard, moves what is over a shard's share to the shards
under theirs, and then sets Kalshi's own target split to the same shares,
which Kalshi rebalances to every 10 seconds, so payouts landing on one
shard are shared out too. It does not refill a shard whose cash orders
spend: at 50/50 on 2026-10-01, shard 0 had spent down to 6.94$ of
51.77$. So run this again when one shard runs low. The money stays in
the account, and nothing is traded. Without --apply it only says what it
would do.

Run from src/ on the instance, where the Kalshi key is, with:
    python3 -m tools.kalshi_shards
    python3 -m tools.kalshi_shards --apply
