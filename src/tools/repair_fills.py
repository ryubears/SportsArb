"""
Repair the live trades recorded under an older reading of Polymarket US fills.

Polymarket US fills an order in pieces as small as a hundredth of a
contract, 0.1 then 0.89 then 0.01 for one. At first each piece was cut to
whole contracts on its own, so an order that filled in full was stored as
filled short or not at all, and its trade was flattened against what it
did not hold: on 2026-09-30, 18 of the first 32 orders there were misread.
Then fills were added up but still cut to whole contracts, so 6.42 was
stored as 6. Now they are counted to the hundredth, see orders.exact().

This reads every stored Polymarket US answer again with
polymarket_us.read_answer(), corrects each order read differently, and works out
each trade with a corrected order again from its orders, as the executor
does: what each leg filled and holds, what that cost, the profit locked
in, and what flattening made or lost. The live executor flattens a
repaired trade holding more on one side than the other at its next start,
by selling the excess back. A trade whose orders sold more of a leg than
it held cannot be written as a trade, so it is left as it is, with every
other trade on its bet, for a human to settle with the venue. Last it
reads each venue's positions and compares them with what the live trades
then hold, contract by contract.

Stop the recorder first, so no order is in flight and the executor reads
the repaired trades when it starts. Without --apply it only says what it
would change. Run from src/ with:
    python3 -m tools.repair_fills
    python3 -m tools.repair_fills --apply
