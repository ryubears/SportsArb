Print how the live trades of the in-play test did beside their paper twins.

The in-play test ran from 2026-10-04 17:49 to 2026-10-05 01:27 UTC. Live
traded 200 times on the games, matches, races, and windows under way, at
no more than 5 contracts, and paper sent a twin of each: the same signal,
the same legs, the same limits, the same size, giving back what our live
orders took from the books, see trading/footprints.py. The twins table
pairs them. Where the two did alike, paper's fills in play are ones live
gets; where live did worse, paper is optimistic there. Since then live
trades games under way at full size with engine.run --live-in-play, and
nothing adds to the table.

The trades with a leg on each venue take turns sending both orders at
once and Polymarket US's first, Kalshi's only once that has answered, so
the two ways are shown apart: those sent at once, with the trades whose
legs were both on one venue, and those sent Polymarket US first. For each,
live and paper side by side: how many filled in full, in part, on one leg
only, or not at all, the contracts asked for and matched, how often each
venue's leg filled, what was locked in and what the sales back made, the
result of those settled, counting what each leg paid out, and each venue's
round trip, measured live and drawn on paper. Then how often the two
matched the same contracts, live fewer, or paper fewer, and the newest
pairs one by one. Reads only, so it is safe to run while the live process
is writing.
