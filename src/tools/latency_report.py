"""
Report how far behind the venues our books ran, and how long our orders took, over a stretch such as a game.

Four sections, all from what the live process already keeps:

- Feeds, from the status line record.log gets every minute: for each venue
  how many book changes arrived a minute, and how far behind the venue they
  reached us, median and 90th percentile, and how much of that was ours.
  The busiest minutes are compared with the quiet ones, which shows whether
  a busy game slows a feed. Until 2026-09-30 Polymarket US's numbers also
  counted the books its trade feed brought early.
- Orders, from the orders table: for each venue and purpose how many filled,
  and the trip there and back, split at the time the venue put on its answer.
- Edges, from the opportunities table: how long the episodes lasted, those
  worth the minimum edge apart, for one sport or all.
- Edges held back, from the executors' summary lines: pairs whose edge
  waited for a Polymarket US book to catch up.

The log gives only the time of day, so each line's date is worked out by
walking back from the end. Reads only, so it is safe to run while the live
process runs, and like summary.py it sets its own import path, so it runs
from any folder.

Run with:
    python3 src/tools/latency_report.py
    python3 src/tools/latency_report.py --since 2026-09-29T17:30 --until 2026-09-29T21:30 --sport mlb
    python3 src/tools/latency_report.py --hours 3 --every 10
