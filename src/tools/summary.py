"""
Print a short summary of the database: the pairs, the opportunities the
executors' rules trade, and the trades.

Everything is shown for the futures, then for the games, matches, races,
and windows in play, each under a heading of its own, see MARKETS: its
opportunities, then its trades for each mode, paper then live, or one
with --mode. Opportunities are shown as live takes them, at once: an
episode counts when one order could have had a whole contract or more,
since a trade opens no fewer, on the levels at live's least edge or more,
see pricing.live_min_edge(): on a future paying config.MIN_PAYOUT_HOURS
or more out, the levels returning config.MIN_ANNUAL_PCT a year, and on a
game under way paying within config.MAX_PAYOUT_HOURS, those at
config.LIVE_IN_PLAY_MIN_EDGE or more once the edge has lasted
config.LIVE_IN_PLAY_HOLD_SECONDS, as live waits for it to. Which moment
is the scanner's, see Opportunity.take_size. Each market shows what those
orders could have taken at full size and what that locks in, overall, by
sport and kind, and the largest, and how long the edge stayed at
config.MIN_EDGE or more, in seconds to the thousandth. A market's trades
show by outcome and by kind for the window, the largest, the legs settled
in it, and the open trades: in a few lines, how many, how many of them
opened in the last hour, day, and week and the capital those hold, the
capital they all hold and the profit they are expected to return, its
rate a year, and when they resolve, then each one opened in the window.
Live's orders follow its trades, then its orders to open by how long the
venue's book had sent nothing when each went out, and how many of those
took something. The paper money and the live money come last. --market
narrows everything to the futures or the games in play, and --sport to
some sports. Reads only, so it is safe to run while the live process is
writing.

The script sets its own import path, so it runs from any folder. The live
money is not in the database but on the venues, so it is read from each
venue with the same read-only calls the live process makes, using the
keys in data/. --no-live leaves that out, and a venue that cannot be read
says why.
