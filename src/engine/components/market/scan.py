"""
Find arbitrage episodes in pairs as the recorder's books change.

Whenever a member's book changes, the scanner finds the cheapest way to
hold yes and the cheapest way to hold no across the pair's members, on two
different venues, or on a future two contracts of one venue with the same
rules, and prices buying both. An episode is a stretch where that net edge
stays above zero after fees. Each episode becomes an Opportunity with its
two legs, its duration, its peak edge, how many contracts could have been
filled at the peak by walking the books' depth, and the return on the
capital tied up, annualized as if held until the bet pays out.

Within an episode the edge worth trading, config.MIN_EDGE or more, may
come and go. The Opportunity also keeps the longest unbroken stretch of it,
and the contracts that stayed fillable at that edge through all of it,
which is what an order sent any time in the stretch could have had, and
so what an edge that lasts is worth. Live takes an edge at once, though,
and its own fill empties the levels it takes, so the Opportunity keeps
too what one order could have had as live takes it: the contracts
fillable on the levels at live's least edge or more, see
pricing.live_min_edge(), and what they lock in, and whether that moment
came with a change of the Polymarket US leg's book. It is the best of the
moments at the peak's edge, and of every moment while none of those had
offered a whole contract: a peak's first moment can offer a fraction of
one, where live, which opens whole contracts, trades a moment later at the
same edge or a little less. Until 2026-10-06 only the peak's first moment
counted, and 21 of 55 live futures trades that evening came from episodes
kept with under a contract. Only the moments once the edge has stayed at
live's least edge or more for config.LIVE_HOLD_SECONDS count, since live
trades it only then: on a game under way from 2026-10-06, on a future from
2026-10-07.

The episode also follows that stretch at live's least edge, see
edge_since(), and keeps when each member's book had last changed as it
began, see edge_books(): live counts a Polymarket US leg's wait for its
book to catch up from the other leg's change as of then, so a change that
leaves the edge where live takes it does not start the wait again.

The recorder drives the Scanner with the books it holds in memory and
the Scanner stores every episode as it ends, so the opportunities table
is the log of everything it saw. The summary script reads it. The
pricing itself lives in pricing.py.

A desk that turns an edge down only to wait for a book to catch up, or
for the edge to last, see edge_since(), asks for the pair again once the
wait ends, through recheck(), so the edge is offered then rather than at
the next change or tick, up to a second later.
