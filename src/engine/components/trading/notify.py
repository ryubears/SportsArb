"""
Tell a human by email.

Live trading asks for a person in three cases: the live venues have
drifted apart and money should be moved between them by hand, live
trading has halted, and the Kalshi key's location attestation is about to
lapse, which AttestationWatch checks. Every alert is logged and stored in the alerts table as it is
raised, and emailed in a background thread, so the loop never waits on the
mail server. Whether the email went out, or why not, is written back to
the alert.

The mail server and addresses are in data/email.json, gitignored like the
venue keys and read at each alert, so they can be added without a restart:

    {"host": "smtp.gmail.com", "port": 587, "user": "me@gmail.com",
     "password": "an app password", "from": "me@gmail.com", "to": ["me@gmail.com"]}

Port 465 connects over TLS from the start, any other port upgrades with
STARTTLS. Without the file the alert is still logged and stored.
