"""
Trade the scanner's signals with real orders on the venues.

The live executor makes the same decisions as the paper one, from the
shared Executor: which signals to take, how many contracts, the limit of
each leg, and how to flatten a leg that filled short. Only the orders
differ. Each is a real immediate or cancel limit order, sent through the
venue client's place_order() on a thread of its own, so an order never
waits behind a settlement lookup or a catalog refresh. A buy's limit is
the leg's limit, and an order that flattens sells no lower than the
deepest price the books said it would reach, so a book that moved leaves
the rest exposed for the next tick rather than filling far from where it
was priced. Every order is stored in the orders table before it is sent
and updated with the venue's answer, and the money is the venues' own,
through LiveBalances from money/live.py.

Both venues fill orders in hundredths of a contract, so fills, holdings,
and the orders that flatten are all counted to the hundredth, while a
trade opens in whole contracts. Every config.LIVE_POSITION_SECONDS the
live executor reads each venue's positions and logs any contract the
venue holds more or less of than the live trades say, which would mean
the records are wrong, see check_positions().

An order whose outcome cannot be known, because no answer came, the venue
failed on its side, or its answer cannot be read, leaves what its trade
holds unknown. That trade is set aside: no more orders are sent for it,
and the log says which order to look up on the venue. No email goes out
for one, but enough of them halt live trading, and the email about the
halt names them all. The rest of live trading goes on. When live trading
halts, whether flattening goes on then, and what counts as a refusal, is
in brakes.py.
