"""
Paper trade the scanner's signals against the live books, timed as live orders are.

The paper executor pretends to send each order the way a live one goes.
An order takes a trip to its venue and a trip back, each drawn around
what the live orders took, see config.PAPER_ORDER_MS. The trip there ends
at the venue's own time on the order, the clock both venues stamp their
books with, and the order fills against the book the venue had then: the
newest it made by then on the contract's tape, which the recorder keeps
while the trade is in flight, see market/tape.py. Our copy of a book runs
behind the venue's, Kalshi's by some 12 ms and Polymarket US's by some 85,
so the order waits for a book the venue made later still, which shows
that every change up to then has reached us, or config.PAPER_FEED_SECONDS
when none comes. A level still there fills, a level that shrank fills
partly, and a level that is gone does not fill. The answer comes back
after the trip back, and a trade whose legs filled unevenly is flattened
on the books we had seen by then, as live trading would, with a sale that
meets the venue's book when it would arrive. Without tapes, as in tests,
an order fills against our newest book when it would arrive.

Until 2026-10-04 an order filled against our newest book a drawn 50 or
60 ms after the signal. For Polymarket US that was the venue's book of
some 20 ms before the signal, while a live order met the one of some 60
ms after, so paper missed the changes in between, when edges go.

It asks for config.FILL_SHARE of what the books show, all of it by
default, and config.PAPER_REJECT_PROBABILITY of its orders are turned away
outright, none by default, as no live order was for no reason paper sees.

A real order takes the contracts it fills, but a paper one leaves the
venue's book as it was, so an edge that stays, or comes back, would be
filled again from the same contracts. So the paper executor remembers what
its orders took from each level and sees every book without it, when it
sizes, fills, and flattens. What it took from a level counts until the
level shrinks below that or goes, as other takers or cancels would have
taken ours too. It learns that when it next looks at the newest book, so
a level gone and back between two looks still has ours taken off, never
more.

Paper trades the games, matches, and races that pay within
config.MAX_PAYOUT_HOURS, in play too. Everything else, the sizing, the
flattening, the order its legs go in, and storing each trade, is the
shared Executor's, and the money is the PaperBalances from money/paper.py.

When live trades the same games in play, run.py --live-in-play, both take
the same signals. Our live orders are real and take from the books paper's
orders meet, so paper adds back what they took, see footprints.py.
