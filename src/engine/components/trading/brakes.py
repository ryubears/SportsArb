When live trading halts.

Real money calls for brakes, sized for a test with about 100 dollars on
each venue. Each rule reads the orders and trades tables, so a restart does
not reset what it has seen, and each starts over after a halt, so what led
to one does not halt live trading again once a human has cleared it.

A halt stops new trades until a human has checked the venues, removed
HALT_FILE, and restarted the process, and what is held is still settled.
Whether flattening goes on depends on the rule. The rules on orders say
the orders themselves are failing, so they stop every order, flattening
included, and do so even after the rule on losses has halted. After a halt
for a loss, flattening goes on, so what is exposed can still be closed. A
restart while HALT_FILE is there keeps the halt as it was,
flattening or not, since exposed trades are taken back at every start.

Live trading halts, with every order stopped, when:

- config.LIVE_UNKNOWN_LIMIT of the last config.LIVE_ORDER_WINDOW orders had
  an unknown outcome: no answer, a venue failing on its side, or an answer
  that cannot be read. That is three in a row, or a steady error rate. One
  such order only sets its own trade aside, see live.py, and the halt names
  every one in the window, since none of them is emailed on its own.
- One venue refused its last config.LIVE_REJECT_LIMIT orders. A refusal is
  the venue answering that it will not take an order, so nothing traded:
  an error status in the 400s, such as not authorized, not enough money,
  a bad price, or too many requests, or Polymarket US rejecting the order,
  for example because the market has closed. An order it took that found
  nothing at its price is unfilled, not refused, and so is one that
  Polymarket US turned away for having no liquidity or for being slow.

Live trading halts, with flattening going on, when the live trades
decided in the last config.LIVE_RESULT_HOURS lost more than
config.LIVE_MAX_LOSS_SHARE of the live money, net.

A trade is decided once its result no longer depends on the game: when
both legs hold the same number of contracts, which pay a dollar each
whichever way the game goes, or once it settles. Its result is what it is
paid, plus what it sold, less what it bought, fees included, from the
orders table. A trade with an order of unknown outcome is left out, since
its records may be wrong.

The live money a loss is measured against is the cash on both venues
plus what open live trades hold, at what it cost.
