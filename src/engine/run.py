"""
Run the live process: follow the books, scan them, trade on paper or with real money, and settle.

What runs, and where it lives in components/: market/ follows the
venues, trading/ makes the trades, and money/ keeps the cash.

- The feeds, from market/streams.py and market/feeds.py. Each venue's
  connections and books run in a child process, which passes every
  changed book on.
- The recorder, from market/record.py, holds the newest book of every
  paired contract in memory. Books are not stored. While a paper order is
  in flight, every book of its contract also goes on a tape, from
  market/tape.py, so the order can meet the venue's book as it was when a
  live order would have arrived.
- The scanner, from market/scan.py, prices each pair a changed book
  belongs to, stores every episode of positive edge in the opportunities
  table, and offers each episode to the desks.
- The attestation watch, from trading/notify.py, which emails a human
  before the Kalshi key's location attestation lapses.
- A Desk for each mode the run trades in, with its own money, executor, and
  settler, and its trades stored with its mode, so paper and live never
  mix. They trade apart: the paper desk the bets on one event, a game, a
  match, a race, or a Bitcoin window, before it and while it is played,
  that pay within MAX_PAYOUT_HOURS, and the live desk the futures, which
  pay MIN_PAYOUT_HOURS or more out, bar the sports given to --not-live.
  On the same signal live's real orders took the contracts paper's
  simulated ones looked for: from 2026-10-04, when live began asking for
  all it saw, paper twins of live trades failed 10 times in 13. Each desk
  still flattens and settles every trade it holds. With --live-in-play
  live also trades the games, matches, races, and windows under way that
  pay within MAX_PAYOUT_HOURS, of every sport, Polymarket US's order
  first, an edge of LIVE_IN_PLAY_MIN_EDGE or more once it has lasted
  LIVE_IN_PLAY_HOLD_SECONDS, at most LIVE_IN_PLAY_CONTRACTS a trade, the
  scanner offering a held edge again once it has lasted, through
  Scanner.edge_since() and recheck(). When paper runs too it trades
  the same games, given back what our live orders took from the books, see
  trading/footprints.py.
  - Paper: trading/paper.py fills against the same books with the paper
    money of money/paper.py.
  - Live: trading/live.py sends real orders with the money the venues
    report through money/live.py, and emails a human through
    trading/notify.py when live trading halts.

The Session ties them together and ticks once a second. Every
CATALOG_MINUTES the catalog of each sport is refreshed in a child process,
fetch then classify then match, and the new pairs' contracts are added to
the running feeds and the closed ones removed, without reconnecting.

One run trades every sport given to --sport, comma separated, or every
sport the catalog knows with --sport all, since the money is one pool: a
second process would spend the same dollars. The catalog holds both the
bets on one event and the futures. A sport given to --not-live has its
futures followed but not traded live, crypto by default, to see how they
do before real money goes on them; --not-live none trades every sport's.
Bitcoin's 15 minute windows open and close all day, so with crypto followed
its catalog is also refreshed just after each window opens.

    python3 -m engine.run --sport nfl
    python3 -m engine.run --sport nfl,ncaaf,mlb,nhl,nba
    python3 -m engine.run --sport all --execute live
