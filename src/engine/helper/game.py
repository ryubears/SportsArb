"""
When a game is played, whether it has started, and when the bets on it pay out.

Every timing assumption about games lives here, so the recorder, the
scanner, and the executor agree on them: when a game is expected to end,
when its money comes back, how long after kickoff it may still be under
way, and whether it has started, after which its pairs are not traded and
their books go stale if they stop changing. How long a game is expected
to last depends on the sport, see config.GAME_HOURS: three in four of the
sport's past games had ended by then. Both venues settled the first live
game, Atlanta at Green Bay, within half an hour of its final whistle.
