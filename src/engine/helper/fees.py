Trading fees for each venue, from their published fee schedules.

Both venues charge takers a fee that peaks at even odds and falls to
zero near certainty, on buys and sells alike. The fee is rounded once per
order, so fee() takes the whole order's contracts. Pricing an edge per
contract uses fee_per_contract(), which is not rounded.

Kalshi, kalshi.com fee schedule, rounded as docs.kalshi.com's fee rounding
page says for an account kept to the hundredth of a cent, as ours is:
    taker fee = round up to the hundredth of a cent of multiplier * 0.07 * contracts * price * (1 - price).
    maker fee = the same with 0.0175, only on series with fee_type quadratic_with_maker_fees.
    The multiplier is stored per contract in fee_info, 1 for sports.
    Kalshi carries what it rounds across an order's fills, so an order
    split over several fills pays what one fill would. Until 2026-10-07
    this rounded up to the cent, as Kalshi once did, but every Kalshi order
    since 2026-09-30, when live trading began, paid to the hundredth of a
    cent: one contract at 19 cents 0.0108$, not 0.02$, and 0.01 of one 0.0002$.

Polymarket US, docs.polymarket.us, fees page:
    taker fee = coefficient * contracts * price * (1 - price), rounded half to even to the cent.
    The coefficient is stored per contract in fee_info as feeCoefficient, 0.0695 for sports.
    Of the 1,134 orders live had filled by 2026-10-07 this matched 980 to
    the cent, and 1,071 rounded fill by fill, as an order filling against
    several sellers is: the rest were a cent apart either way.
