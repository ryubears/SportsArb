"""
The settings that decide what the live process does, in one place.

Each is read when it is used, as config.NAME, so engine.run's --set can
change one for a run, and the run logs them all when it starts. What
belongs here is what a run might be tuned by. What a venue's protocol or
fee schedule fixes stays with the code for that venue. A setting only
paper trading reads starts with PAPER_, one only live trading reads starts
with LIVE_, and the rest hold for both.

Override one for a run with --set, for example:
    python3 -m engine.run --sport nfl --set min_edge=0.03 --set min_annual_pct=20
